## Project Summary
MineExpress is an Artificial Intelligence project developed for routing or delivery tasks, like amazon shipping, Uber, or UberEat. Our goal is to train our agent to pick up and drop off packages or food to the right places. At the same time, we aim to find an optimal path to navigate our agent to those places. To achieve this, we utilized three methods: q-learning algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm, and random action. Q-learning is our main algorithm. It utilized an agent-environment loop shown below. Within each process, the agent chooses an action, and the environment returns an observation and rewards. We will visualize this process of learning in the game Minecraft and Malmo platform.
This project took inspiration from taxi-v3 from Gym (OpenAI) by stimulating the same game settings where our agent has pickup and drop-off actions and finds the optimal path.
Motivation: 
During the period of the covid virus, many people stayed at home to ensure their safety. At this time, food and express delivery often face the problem of insufficient manpower. An AI that can adapt to any environment and perform such work can greatly facilitate people's lives. We hope to develop such AI. It should not pick up or drop off the package at the wrong place. It should also choose the right path that minimizes the total delivery time. Using AI/ML algorithms is essential because it allows our agent to learn from the environment. Our agent can thus adapt to any new environment. In many real situations, the environment will not be known to the agent, for example, a pizza delivery AI wants to deliver the food to a new neighborhood. AI/ML algorithms allow the AI to learn human intervention.
