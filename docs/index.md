MineExpress is a reinforcement learning/Q-learning related project. An agent that starts a random position will go to a random destination within the minimum amount of time and avoid dropping into the lava. The path contains blocks with different moving speeds, thus we train our agent to find the optimal path. We will utilize Minecraft and Malmo to visualize our project.
