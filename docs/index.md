## About MineExpress:
MineExpress is an Artificial Intelligence Malmo based project developed for any type of routing or delivery tasks, like Uber and amazon shipping. Our goal is to provide the most efficient method of traveling with many other actions taking into account.  An agent that starts a random position will go to a random destination within the minimum amount of time and avoid dropping into the lava. The path contains blocks with different moving speeds, thus we train our agent to find the optimal path. We will utilize Minecraft and Malmo to visualize our project.
